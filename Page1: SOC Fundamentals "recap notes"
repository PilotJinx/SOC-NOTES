2023-05-29 13:02:47.838" and once again we have another domain that wants to mimic google in a way. What dns exploit could this be then spoofing or poison?
ChatGPT
Based on the provided log entry, it appears to be a DNS query initiated from the source IP address 172.16.17.173. The query is made for the domain www.chatgptforgoogle.pro, and it originates from the process C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe.

There are several aspects of this log entry that could indicate potential malicious activity:

The domain "www.chatgptforgoogle.pro" seems suspicious and may be an attempt to impersonate or mimic a legitimate Google-related domain. This behavior is consistent with DNS spoofing, where attackers forge DNS responses to redirect users to malicious websites.

The DNS query result includes multiple IP addresses (::ffff:52.76.101.124;::ffff:3.1.17.18;::ffff:18.140.6.45), which could indicate an attempt to perform DNS cache poisoning. In DNS cache poisoning attacks, attackers inject false DNS records into the cache of a DNS resolver, leading to the redirection of users to malicious websites.

The source IP address 172.16.17.173 is a private IP address, suggesting that the DNS query originates from a local network. If this query is unauthorized or unexpected, it could indicate compromised or malicious activity within the network.

Overall, the log entry raises significant concerns regarding potential DNS-related attacks, such as DNS spoofing or cache poisoning. It is crucial to investigate further, analyze network traffic patterns, and implement appropriate security measures to mitigate the risk of such attacks.

Query Result: Multiple IP addresses (::ffff:52.76.101.124;::ffff:3.1.17.18;::ffff:18.140.6.45)
Potential DNS Cache Poisoning: The query result includes multiple IP addresses, indicating a potential attempt to perform DNS cache poisoning.
Overall Diagnosis:
The logs collectively suggest a pattern of suspicious DNS activity originating from the Chrome browser process associated with the account "Samuel." These activities include attempts to access domains that resemble legitimate Google-related domains and potentially manipulate DNS responses. This behavior raises concerns about possible DNS spoofing or cache poisoning attempts targeting the local network. Further investigation and mitigation measures are warranted to address these potential security threats.

User
Right, and then would google not use port 443 instead of port 80, is that correct?
ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct. Google and many other secure websites typically use HTTPS, which operates over port 443, for secure communication. Port 443 is the standard port for HTTPS traffic, which encrypts data transmitted between the web server and the client's browser. Therefore, if the destination is a legitimate Google-related domain, it would be expected to use port 443 for HTTPS communication rather than port 80 for unencrypted HTTP traffic. The presence of traffic on port 80 instead of port 443 for Google-related domains in the provided logs raises additional suspicion regarding the legitimacy of the connections and suggests potential security risks.

User
i am going through a playbook exercise regarding the data we just went over, the exercise is as follows: " Check If Someone Requested the C2
Please go to the "Log Management" page and check if the C2 address accessed. You can check if the malicious file is run by searching the C2 addresses of the malicious file.

Log Management
Please click "Accessed" if someone access the malicious address. Otherwise please click "Not Accessed" button." could you please explain what is meant by C2? is this refering to a particular playbook in the SIEM/SOAR combination? Also i am not sure that in this case some one accessed the mailcious address. But since its a dns attack, the anwser is likely  "Accessed" or am i wrong?
ChatGPT
In cybersecurity, "C2" typically stands for "Command and Control." A Command and Control server is a centralized server used by attackers to send commands to compromised devices (often referred to as bots or zombies) and to receive stolen data or instructions from these devices. The goal of a C2 server is to maintain control over the compromised network and to facilitate malicious activities, such as launching further attacks, exfiltrating sensitive data, or carrying out other nefarious actions.

In the context of the playbook exercise you provided, "Check If Someone Requested the C2," it likely refers to checking if any device in the network attempted to access the Command and Control server. Accessing the C2 server could indicate that a device within the network has been compromised or is attempting to communicate with the attacker's infrastructure.

Regarding your uncertainty about whether someone accessed the malicious address in the logs you provided, it depends on the specific details of the logs and the context of your network. If the logs show traffic directed towards the suspicious addresses (potentially indicative of attempted communication with the C2 server), then selecting "Accessed" would be appropriate. However, if there is no evidence of such traffic or if the logs indicate that the connections were blocked or unsuccessful, then selecting "Not Accessed" would be more accurate.

Ultimately, the decision should be based on the analysis of the log data and any relevant security policies or guidelines in your organization. If you're unsure, it may be helpful to consult with a more experienced colleague or a security specialist for guidance.

The logs show DNS queries for domains that mimic legitimate ones, such as "www.chatgptforgoogle.pro," which could suggest attempts at DNS spoofing or poisoning. Additionally, the presence of a suspicious Chrome extension and network connections to potentially malicious IP addresses further supports the possibility of a compromised DNS.

However, to confirm whether the DNS has indeed been compromised, further investigation and analysis are required. This may involve examining network traffic, reviewing DNS server logs, and conducting security assessments to identify any signs of unauthorized access or malicious activity.

User
Ok so i contained the users machine as it turns out it was indeed an extension deleted from google chrome store due to malware.
ChatGPT
Containment of the user's machine was a prudent step given the presence of a malicious Chrome extension. Removing the extension from the user's browser and isolating the machine from the network helps prevent further potential damage or unauthorized access to other systems. Additionally, it's essential to conduct further analysis and remediation to ensure that any lingering traces of the malware are thoroughly eradicated from the affected system and to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Common Mistakes made by SOC Analysts:

1.Over-reliance on VirusTotal Results
  - Accept VT as supporting tool
  - Perform thorough analyses
2.Hasty Analysis of Malware in a Sandbox
  - Consider duration and environment
3.Inadequate Log Analysis
  - Use Log Management solutions
  - Check for connections to suspicious addresses
4. Overlooking VirusTotal Dates
  - Conduct new searches instead of relying on cache
